<p style="color:green;"> In Hindhu mythology, Nandini is the abode for God Shiva. Nandini is very famous in Hindhu as wherever she takes a step, there will be plentiful of harvest wherever she goes. Therefore, her name is celebrated as Joy. <br>

Mahaputra brings this philosophy to our heart, guiding our service excellence to its finest. We are inspired by the Joy celebrated by Nandini and would love to share this to all of our guests, bringing the Joy people will never forget. <br>

Mahaputra is set deep within a beautiful rainforest, with stunning views across the valley.

From the moment you arrive at this luxury spa resort you can immerse yourself in the beauty of this calm oasis, taking in the incredible sights and gentle sounds of the forest below and breathing in the fresh mountain air.
