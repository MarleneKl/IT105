<h2>Dolphins </h2>
        
<p>
<i>Dolphins are aquatic mammals belonging to the Infraorder Cetacea.
They are highly intelligent creatures who can learn individually and pass on new information to others. 
They are capable of complex problem solving and social interaction. Although dolphins live in water, they are not fish. 
They breathe through a blowhole on the top of their head, give birth to their young ones, feed them milk and have body hair. 
Thus, they are classified as marine mammals.</i>
